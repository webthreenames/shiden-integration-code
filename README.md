Shiden devs that want to resolve .shiden domain names to wallet address can refer to the sample code in this repo.

Note that domain names are not case-sensitive.

Note regarding Astar - There are public endpoints available for development on Shibuya (testnet) but for Astar or Shiden, you'll need to get your own endpoint from one of the supported providers. You can always run your own RPC nodes. Ref: https://docs.astar.network/docs/quickstart/endpoints
